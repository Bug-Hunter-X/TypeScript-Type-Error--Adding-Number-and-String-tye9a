# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript: attempting to add a number and a string.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code calls it with a number and a string, resulting in a type error. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error using type guards or other TypeScript features.
